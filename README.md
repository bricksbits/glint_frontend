# Flutter Project - Developer Build Guide

All builds are now provided as **runnable shell scripts** (`.sh`) inside the `scripts/` folder.  
Open any script in Android Studio / IntelliJ, and you will see the ▶️ run button in the gutter.  
Alternatively, run them from terminal with `./scripts/<script>.sh`.
